Easy (done?)
1. n -> three vertices of a triangle having exactly n lattice points on its
   border and 3 lattice points as its vertices.
Easy
2. 3 lattice points -> the number of lattice points on the border of the
   triangle formed by the input
Medium-hard (done?)
3. n -> the total number of multiplications and additions required to get n
   from 1's
Easy (done?) 
4. n -> a monotone chain of n lattice points
Medium
5. Geometry median of 4 points (almost done?)
Either one of the four points or the intersection of two line segments
Medium-easy (done?)
6. n k a-> given a DAG of n vertices of degree at most k such that there are
   at least a^n distinct paths from 1 to n.
Medium-easy(?)
7. most joyful path of bounded-length
Medium
8. run-length encoding (almost done)
define run of a binray string
