The first line contains an integer $n$ which is the length of the sequence. 
The second line contains $n$ integers denoting the elements of the sequence $s_0,\dots,s_{n-1}$. 
The third line contains an integer $q$, the number of operations. 
Then the following $q$ lines are operations in one of following forms:

\begin{itemize}
\item $1~\ell~r~v$: increase the elements in range $[\ell, r)$(including $\ell$ and excluding $r$) by $v$. 
		A negative $v$ means decreasing by $-v$.
\item $2~\ell~r$: query the greatness of $s_\ell,\dots,s_{r-1}$.
\end{itemize}
