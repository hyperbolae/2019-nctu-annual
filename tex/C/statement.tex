It's September and your little brother starts elementary school.
For better ergonomics, the teacher has to know who are taller or shorter to select their tables and chairs.
One noticeable thing is some pupils have difficulty telling who's taller if they're of the same height standing on different chairs.
To help the pupils understand, the teacher makes them compare their heights several times and notes the results on a sheet.
There are $n$ pupils, whose heights are $H_1$, $H_2$, $\ldots$, and $H_n$, conducting $m$ comparisons in the class.
There are many chairs, each of which has height either $C_1$, $C_2$, $\ldots$, or $C_k$, while $C_0 = 0$ denotes the ground.
Since some pupils may report the results incorrectly, the teacher needs you to check if there is any error on the sheet.
