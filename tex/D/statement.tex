Matryoshka dolls (Russian dolls) are a set of wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside another. 
Alice is now manufacturing a new kind of Matryoshka dolls. The new Matryoshka dolls can contain multiple 
doll sets at once (while not nested). To clearify the problem, we assign a size value for each type of dolls. 
For a doll with size $k$, it can contain a multiple doll sets if the sum of their outermost layers' size are 
strictly smaller than $k$. We also assign a pretty value for every type of dolls. The pretty value of a doll 
set is the sum of the pretty value of each dolls inside it.

Alice wants to make a new doll with size $x$, if the pretty value of this doll is zero, can you tell her 
the maximum pretty value of the doll set if this doll is the outermost doll? Assuming that she have 
infinite numbers of every kind of existing dolls.
