Hank likes colorful triangles.
He collects many sticks in various colors and wants to use them to build as many triangles as possible 
under the following constraints.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each triangle must consist of exactly three sticks of distinct colors.
	\item Every pair of triangles must consist of sticks of at least five distinct colors.
\end{enumerate}

For example, if Hank builds a triangle with the color red, blue, and green,
he cannot to build another triangle with color red, blue, and purple. This violate the second constraint. 

You just discovered that Hank's collection of sticks has exactly $3^n$ different color in total. 
And there are at least $2^{100}$ sticks of each color.
Hank is too tired during the final exam period, so he asks you to help him to build the triangle.
