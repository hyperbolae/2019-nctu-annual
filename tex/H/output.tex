The first line contain a number $m$ -- the number of triangle you can build.
If $m$ is no greater than $10^5$, then you have to output $m$ more lines to show how to build the triangles.
Each of the $m$ lines will contain three number indicate the colors of sticks building the corresponding triangle.
Use only the integers between $1$ to $3^n$ to indicate the different color. 
If there are multiple answer, you can print any of them.
