One of \texttt{mangojunior}'s jobs is to deal with the management affairs of a mysterious classroom. 
The classroom is a $r\times c$ grid, so there are totally $r\times c$ blocks. 
There are $n$ craft chairs numbered from $1$ to $n$ in the classroom.
They are designed to be stacked on a certain magic block which lies on the intersection of row $i$ and column $j$.
Moreoever, chair $k$ can be put over the top of some chair numbered with an integer less than $k$, 
and chairs are not allowed to be stacked on all the other blocks.
 
\texttt{mangojunior} plans to clean up the classroom. 
He observed that there is no chair on the magic block, so he can clean it first.
Then, he can stack all the chairs on the magic block and clean the other blocks.
In every step, \texttt{mangojunior} can select chair $k$ and move it to an adjacent block which
must be a block without chair or the magic block with a stack of chairs of number less than $k$.
During the final exam period, \texttt{mangojunior} is exhausted. 
Once a chair moved into the magic block, \texttt{mangojunior} does not have enough energy to move it to another block. 
Please help \texttt{mangojunior} determine how many steps does he need to move all chairs to the magic block?
